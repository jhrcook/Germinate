/**
 A view controller for editing a note.
 
 There are three main regions: the buttons along the top, a date picker in the middle, and a text view at the bottom.
 The two buttons at the top are "Save" and "Cancel."
 When the text view is tapped on, it is moved to the middle and a new button, "Done," is animated in place of the original two.
 Tapping the "Done" button brings back the original view.
